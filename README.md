Your task for this assignment is to write a program that is able to decode IDs from two
different bars (Bar1 and Bar2), check for duplicate IDs, sort the IDs in ascending order, and print
a report of the IDs indicating which IDs are guilty and which are innocent. An ID is guilty if it
appears more than once, and an ID is innocent if it appears only once
